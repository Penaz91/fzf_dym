FZF-DYM
=======

A simple VimScript "Did you Mean..." plugin based on FZF. Based on my personal VimRC, now extracted to a standalone plugin

Requirements
------------

- [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [FZF.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim)

Setup
-----

I personally use vim-plug, but this can probably be adapted to other systems

```
Plug 'penaz91/fzf_dym'
```
